# Genetic Algorithm

depth-first search,breadth-first search, greedy best first search and A∗ search algorithm that's based on a game that involves moving a stack of numbered coins from a central pile to separate "Odd" and "Even" side piles. Odd-numbered coins go to circles A or C, and even-numbered coins to B or D, using the fewest moves. Only the top coin of any stack can be moved, and coins must follow two rules: higher numbers can't be placed on lower ones, and odd coins can’t go on even coins (or vice versa). The goal is to sort all coins according to these rules with each move costing 1.
